# FlowCtl Architecture

## Overview

FlowCtl is designed as a distributed system with clear separation of concerns. The architecture follows microservices principles with each component having specific responsibilities.

## System Components

### 1. Scheduler (Core Engine)

**Technology**: Go
**Responsibilities**:
- Workflow orchestration and scheduling
- Task dependency resolution
- State management coordination
- Worker health monitoring
- API endpoint serving

**Key Features**:
- DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) execution
- At-least-once delivery guarantees
- Fault tolerance with automatic recovery
- Horizontal scaling support

### 2. Workers

**Technology**: Language-agnostic (Go reference implementation)
**Responsibilities**:
- Task execution
- Result reporting
- Health reporting via heartbeats
- Error handling and retry logic

**Communication**:
- REST API for task status updates
- Redis for task polling
- gRPC support for high-performance scenarios

### 3. State Store (PostgreSQL)

**Purpose**: Persistent storage for workflow metadata
**Stored Data**:
- Workflow definitions and status
- Task definitions and execution history
- Configuration and settings
- Audit logs

**Schema Design**:
- Optimized for read-heavy workloads
- Proper indexing for performance
- Foreign key constraints for data integrity

### 4. Task Queue (Redis)

**Purpose**: High-performance task queuing and coordination
**Data Structures Used**:
- Lists for task queues
- Sorted sets for retry scheduling
- Hash maps for worker registration
- Pub/Sub for real-time notifications

### 5. Web Dashboard

**Technology**: React.js
**Features**:
- Real-time workflow visualization
- Task status monitoring
- Worker health dashboard
- System metrics and analytics

## Data Flow

### Workflow Submission

1. **Client** submits workflow via API or YAML file
2. **Scheduler** validates workflow and creates database records
3. **Scheduler** analyzes dependencies and queues ready tasks
4. **Redis** stores tasks in appropriate queues by type

### Task Execution

1. **Worker** polls Redis for tasks of supported types
2. **Worker** dequeues task and updates status to "running"
3. **Worker** executes task logic and captures results
4. **Worker** reports completion/failure back to scheduler
5. **Scheduler** updates database and triggers dependent tasks

### Error Handling

1. **Worker** reports task failure to scheduler
2. **Scheduler** evaluates retry policy
3. If retries remain: task moved to retry queue with delay
4. If max retries exceeded: task moved to dead letter queue
5. **Dashboard** displays failed tasks for manual intervention

## Scalability Design

### Horizontal Scaling

**Scheduler Scaling**:
- Multiple scheduler instances can run concurrently
- Leader election for critical operations
- Shared state via PostgreSQL
- Load balancing via reverse proxy

**Worker Scaling**:
- Workers auto-register with scheduler
- Dynamic scaling based on queue depth
- Support for heterogeneous worker pools
- Container orchestration friendly

### Performance Optimization

**Database Optimization**:
- Read replicas for reporting queries
- Connection pooling
- Proper indexing strategy
- Partitioning for large datasets

**Queue Optimization**:
- Redis clustering for high throughput
- Separate queues by task type
- Priority queues for urgent tasks
- Batch processing capabilities

## Fault Tolerance

### Scheduler Resilience

- Health checks and automatic restart
- Circuit breakers for external dependencies
- Graceful degradation modes
- State recovery from persistent storage

### Worker Resilience

- Heartbeat monitoring
- Automatic task reassignment
- Resource leak protection
- Crash recovery mechanisms

### Data Resilience

- PostgreSQL high availability setup
- Redis persistence and replication
- Backup and recovery procedures
- Cross-region disaster recovery

## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization

- JWT-based API authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Service-to-service authentication
- API rate limiting and throttling

### Data Protection

- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Sensitive data masking in logs
- Secrets management integration
- Audit trail for all operations

### Network Security

- TLS for all communications
- Network segmentation
- Firewall rules and security groups
- VPN access for management

## Monitoring & Observability

### Metrics Collection

- Prometheus-compatible metrics
- Custom business metrics
- Performance counters
- Resource utilization tracking

### Logging Strategy

- Structured logging (JSON format)
- Centralized log aggregation
- Log correlation across services
- Retention policies

### Alerting

- Real-time error detection
- Performance threshold monitoring
- Capacity planning alerts
- On-call escalation procedures

## Deployment Strategies

### Container Orchestration

**Kubernetes Deployment**:
- StatefulSets for schedulers
- Deployments for workers
- ConfigMaps for configuration
- Secrets for sensitive data
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaling

**Docker Compose** (Development):
- Single-machine development setup
- Service dependencies
- Volume mounts for data
- Environment configuration

### Infrastructure as Code

- Terraform for cloud resources
- Helm charts for Kubernetes
- Ansible for configuration management
- GitOps deployment workflows

## Development Workflow

### Code Organization

```

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for core logic
- Integration tests for components
- End-to-end workflow tests
- Performance and load testing
- Chaos engineering practices

### CI/CD Pipeline

1. Code commit triggers build
2. Automated testing suite runs
3. Security scanning and compliance checks
4. Docker image building and pushing
5. Automated deployment to staging
6. Manual approval for production
7. Blue-green deployment strategy
8. Automated rollback on failures

This architecture provides a solid foundation for a production-ready distributed task queue and workflow orchestrator that can scale to handle enterprise workloads while maintaining reliability and performance.
